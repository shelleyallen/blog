Hi, I'm Shelley Allen, I hope to use this blog to do some data analysis, visualisation, machine learning and changepoint detection on publicly available datasets.

A long time ago I did a BSc in Computer Science and then PhD in Information Retrieval (as it was called then, perhaps now Text Mining) and Machine Learning at Exeter University. My supervisor was the amazing [Richard Everson](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/reverson) and the PhD was sponsored by BT and the EPSRC. I mainly used mainly Python and Matlab. We were looking at building statistical representations of a person's interests from all the 'documents' they interacted with whilst on their computer. We used Topic Modelling methods to represent the interests, specifically PLSA (probabilistic latent semantic analysis) and [LDA (latent dirichlet allocation)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf). Other work during that time included text classification and multi-objective optimisation. 

I went on to do a postdoc (again at Exeter University with Richard Everson) funded by Motorola. One of the main projects was Changepoint Analysis to understand the changes made to telecommunication networks after an optimisation. We developed a Bayesian changepoint algorithm that combined evidence from multiple timeseries using Python and Matlab. 

After the postdoc, I became a Ruby-on-Rails developer working for a software house and then Scholastic. In both of these roles, I learnt a great deal about programming, testing and working as part of an agile team. 
In my next two roles, I was lucky enough to do lots of data science. I developed a ruby [changepoint gem](https://github.com/shelleyallen/changepoints) that combines a bunch of different changepoint methods to predict changepoints in timeseries data. Changepoint detection methods were useful for large scale PPC advertisting timeseries to enabling analysts to focus their attention where it was most needed. During this time, I was also introduced to R, I was astonished how much easier ggplot made making beautiful data visualisations and at the number of packages available to perform data analysis and machine learning. 

In July 2016, I stopped work to home-educate my son who has ASD and have been on a career break ever since. I've been using DataCamp to keep up to date with R and especially the tidyverse.
